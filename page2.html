        <h1>Origins of Western Music</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Early America's Dilemma</h2>
        <p>
            In its early days, America lacked unified music. Everyone in America belonged to different ethnicities and had different roots, ranging from Irish to British to Jewish. Americans didn't share enough common background and culture to allow for the development of American folk tunes or dances that all Americans can unite under. Folk tunes are generally characteristic of a nation's music. Russian music often has russian folk tunes, German music often has german folk tunes, etc. For a long time after the revolutionary war, Western music was virtually nonexistent. All American composers simply mirrored European composers. You couldn't tell an American composer's works apart from Brahms' or Liszt's.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            An example of one of these early American composers is George Chadwick, born in 1854.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Works</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Melopene Overture (Reflecting Wagner's style)</li>
                <li>Thalia Overture (Reflecting Mendelssohn's style)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Note: Chadwick, later on, did compose more Western-style music when it became widespread in America.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Realization</h2>
        <p>
            In the late 1800s, Dvorak, a Czech composer, came to America. He discovered the lack of American music, and decided to help America develop its own music. So in 1893, he composes Symphony No. 9 (New World Symphony), which he based off of native american and african american melodies. This may have seemed American to Dvorak, but most people in America at the time were neither native american nor african american. Thus, many Americans did not really connect to it. In fact, many say that New World Symphony sounds more Czech than anything else. However, despite this apparent failure to compose American music, it sparked a nationwide interest in composing music that is truly "American" using native american and african american themes.
        </p>
        <h2>American Composers trying to sound American</h2>
        <p>
            After Dvorak's New World Symphony, American composers rushed to gather native american and african american folk tunes. They would follow in Dvorak's footsteps, and as a result, their music didn't sound American either. Their problem was that they were trying too hard. Composing music of their nation should come naturally. Forcing it will not result in it sounding American. Some notable composers are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Edward MacDowell (1860-1908)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Second (Indian) Suite</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used many native american melodies</li>
                    <li>Sounded ironically like Dvorak</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Henry Gilbert (1868-1928)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dance in Place Congo</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used Creole folk tunes</li>
                    <li>Sounded more african than american</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Birth of Jazz</h2>
        <p>
            After World War I, jazz became prominent throughout the U.S.. Jazz was something that all Americans can relate to, can dance to. This was exactly what America needed. A "folk tune". American composers who grew up during this time were exposed to jazz extensively. It was a huge part of their childhood, and when they would compose in their adult life, jazz became a natural part of their music. Jazz would shape much of the Western music.
        </p>
        <h2>The Rise of Western Music</h2>
        <p>
            As Americans and America go through more and more together (World War II, Vietnam War, Great Depression, etc.), the feeling of nationalism amongst Americans heightens and they began to share more ideals. These ideals and the sense of nationalism flowed naturally into American composers and their music and finally, Western Music was born. It was an union of all the cultures that make up America, but still highlights each culture's individuality.
        </p>
        <h2>The Defining Characteristics of Western Music</h2>
        <h4>Jazz</h4>
        <p>
            jazz is an important element of American Music. Jazz themes can be observed in nearly all styles of American music, including classical music and even religious music.
        </p>
        <h4>The American Spirit</h4>
        <p>
            The American Spirit is another vital part of American Music. As a result, American music sounds youthful, strong, and awfully optimistic (like Hollywood movies). At the heart of the American Spirit, there is also a ruggedness and rural energy that seeps into American music.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>More characteristics:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>A distinctive feature of American Music is the unique lonely feeling that it communicates. It isn’t a sad lonely, but more of a calm lonely.</li>
            <li>Another major defining quality of American Music is the sweet simpleness that it contains.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It would be impossible to list all of the qualities that make up American music due to the diversity amongst Americans. But that's the most unique part of American music: the diversity of it.
        </p>
