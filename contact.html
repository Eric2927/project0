            <li>What got you into music?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I would say that my experience learning piano at a young age helped spark my musical interest and has made my future musical endeavors much easier.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Where do you attend high school?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I spent my freshmen and sophmore years at Westborough high school, and I am going to spend my junior and senior years at Mass Academy of Math and Science.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Where did you get the inspiration to make this website?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I've watched a lot of Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts, and one of the episodes was about Western Music. I thought it would be cool to summarize that episode into this website.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Do you have a similarly simple website about symphonic music? If not, can you make one? Or give me a simple summary of the key composers?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I can only offer a simple summary for now. I'll consider making another website later. Note: The following content is drastically simplified.
